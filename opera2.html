        <h4>SONG-POOH-BAH with NANKI-POO and PISH-TUSH.</h4>

    <pre><p class="song">
        Young man, despair,
            Likewise go to,
        Yum-Yum the fair
            You must not woo.
            It will not do:
            I'm sorry for you,
        You very imperfect ablutioner!
            This very day
                From school Yum-Yum
            Will wend her way,
                And homeward come,
                With beat of drum
                And a rum-tum-tum,
        To wed the Lord High executioner!
            And the brass will crash,
                And the trumpets bray,
            And they'll cut a dash
                On their wedding day.
        She'll toddle away, as all aver,
        With the Lord High Executioner '
        </p></pre>

  <h4 class="name">NANK. and POOH.</h4>  <p class="speech">And the brass will crash, etc.</p>

    <pre><p class="song">
        It's a hopeless case,
            As you may see,
        And in your place
            Away I'd flee;
            But don't blame me-
            I'm sorry to be
        Of your pleasure a diminutioner.
            They'll vow their pact
                Extremely soon,
            In point of fact
                This afternoon.
                Her honeymoon
                With that buffoon
        At seven commences, so you shun her!
    </p></pre>
