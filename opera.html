          ACT I.<br>
          SCENE.-Courtyard of Ko-Ko's Palace in Titipu.  Japanese nobles
               discovered standing and sitting in attitudes suggested by
               native drawings.
     </h3>
     
     <p>Enter Pooh-Bah.</p>

     <h4>NANK.</h4>  
     <p>Ko-Ko, the cheap tailor, Lord High Executioner of
     Titipu! Why, that's the highest rank a citizen can attain!</p>
     <h4>POOH.</h4>  
     <p>It is.  Our logical Mikado, seeing no moral
     difference between the dignified judge who condemns a criminal to
     die, and the industrious mechanic who carries out the sentence,
     has rolled the two offices into one, and every judge is now his
     own executioner.</p>
     <h4>NANK.</h4>  
     <p>But how good of you (for I see that you are a
     nobleman of the highest rank) to condescend to tell all this to
     me, a mere strolling minstrel!</p>
     <h4>POOH.</h4>  
     <p>Don't mention it.  I am, in point of fact, a
     particularly haughty and exclusive person, of pre-Adamite
     ancestral descent.  You will understand this when I tell you that
     I can trace my ancestry back to a protoplasmal primordial atomic
     globule.  Consequently, my family pride is something
     inconceivable.  I can't help it.  I was born sneering.  But I
     struggle hard to overcome this defect.  I mortify my pride
     continually.  When all the great officers of State resigned in a
     body because they were too proud to serve under an ex-tailor, did
     I not unhesitatingly accept all their posts at once?</p>
     <h4>PISH.</h4>  <p>And the salaries attached to them?  You did.</p>
     <h4>POOH.</h4>  
     <p>It is consequently my degrading duty to serve this
     upstart as First Lord of the Treasury, Lord Chief Justice,
     Commander-in-Chief, Lord High Admiral, Master of the Buckhounds,
     Groom of the Back Stairs, Archbishop of Titipu, and Lord Mayor,
     both acting and elect, all rolled into one.  And at a salary!  A
     Pooh-Bah paid for his services!  I a salaried minion!  But I do
     it!  It revolts me, but I do it!</p>
     <h4>NANK.</h4> <p>And it does you credit.</p>
     <h4>POOH.</h4>  
     <p>But I don't stop at that.  I go and dine with
     middle-class people on reasonable terms.  I dance at cheap
     suburban parties for a moderate fee.  I accept refreshment at any
     hands, however lowly.  I also retail State secrets at a very low
     figure.  For instance, any further information about Yum-Yum
     would come under the head of a State secret.  <p>(Nanki-Poo takes his
     hint, and gives him money.)</p>  <p>(Aside.)</p>  Another insult and, I
     think, a light one!</p>
